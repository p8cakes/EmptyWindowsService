    /// This class provides semaphore-like behavior that lets threads enqueue, waiting for a certain event.
    /// That event is the notification from an external thread to wake the first one (or everyone) up
    /// from the waiting list for a green light. All methods are thread-safe. Class maintained public, so
    /// client assemblies could leverage stop-n-go functionality themselves, outside of a thread pool by
    /// instantiating ThreadLock objects within their execution paths. Consult class documentation in code
    /// though. Employ this with one of the three following use cases:
    /// Use Case 1: Waiter & Caller alternate - WaitForNotification. Caller & Waiter - NotifyThread
    /// Use Case 2: Waiter (one of many that can be woken together) - WaitForMultiNotification. Caller - NotifyAllThreads
    /// Use Case 3: Waiter (self-sleeper) - FlagAndWaitForNotification. Caller - NotifyThread
    /// </summary>
